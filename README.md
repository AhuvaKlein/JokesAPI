# JokesAPI

Assignment:

Create an application that displays a list of random programming jokes to the user. Use this api to get the random jokes:

https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/random

This application will also have a login system where users can login/signup to the site.

When a logged in user visits the site, they will see a like/dislike option next to the joke. If they've previously liked the joke, then the like button should be disabled, and the dislike should be enabled. If they've disliked it in the past, then the opposite should happen. A user should only be able to change their mind within 10 minutes (or whatever time interval you choose).

Finally, the application should have a page where it displays a list of all jokes ever displayed to any user, with a count of how many likes and dislikes each joke has.

Use Entity Framework for all the db code. 

Good luck!
